# plotter-sketches

Hello! This is where I keep all my "sketches" of generative art. I use a tool called `canvas-sketch` to run these files in my browser. From there I can save them as a `.png` and `.svg` for use with a pen-plotter. 

This repository is primarily for personal organization and storage of my art. Some of the older files might have broken imports to the `util` folder if I haven't ran them in a while.
